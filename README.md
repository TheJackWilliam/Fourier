# Fourier Transform Project

## Description
This project is focused on recreating an input drawing and reacreating it using fourier tansform techniques.
This is programmed in Processing, a language that resembles and complies to Java code.
See the demo below for demo for how this performs.

### Demo Explanation
* The top left frame shows the input waveform, 
* the top right frame shows wrapping the input around the complex frame and measuring the resulting 'center of mass',
* the bottom left frame shows the fourier transform magnitude, complex components, and phase from top to bottom,
* and the bottom right shows the recreation of the waveform using the fourier transform magnitude and phase information
